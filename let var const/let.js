// The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript. It has the Global scoped or function scoped which means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.

// The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it and have to assign it with a value at the time of declaration. These variables also have the block scope. It is mainly used to create constant variables whose values can not be changed once they are initialized with a value.

// The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. It is introduced in the ES6 or EcmaScript 2015. These variables has the block scope. It canâ€™t be accessible outside the particular code block ({block}).
